Description: The kawa compiler can be used to compile scheme code into
bytecode. The benchmark here consists of compiling the all the .scm files
found  directory testdir. The generated class files are then outputed into
the directory testdir/resultdir. Once all files are compiled, the
content of resultdir and all it's files is verified against the
reference class files found in directory testdir/refdir.


Note:
The scheme files found in testdir are taken from:

under dir testdir/gimp-files:  the gimp version 1.0.0 (www.gimp.org) (GPL).
under dir testdir/slib:  The Scheme Library, maintained by Aubrey Jaffer (from the Scheme repository) (GPL)
