Petablox-Bench
==============

This repository contains the benchmarks that are used along with the petablox project.
Each benchmark needs to be compiled by running ``ant`` within the benchmark folder.

The benchmark can then be made the work directory to be used with petablox.
For example:

    petablox.work.dir=<path-to-petablox-bench>/dacapo/benchmarks/avrora
