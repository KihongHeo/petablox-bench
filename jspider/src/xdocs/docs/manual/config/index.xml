  <p>

  This section is a reference for every piece of configuration that can be done with JSpider.
  </p>
  <p>
    //TODO: This section is still to be expanded.  Only a few configuration issues are explained for the moment,
    extra information has to be added.
  </p>

  <subsection name="Environment Configuration">
    <p>
    This type of configuration is used to tell JSpider in what type of environment (network,...) it is operating,
    and how it should handle this.  This type of configuration is done in the 'jspider.properties' file, which can
    be found under the /conf/{yourconfig} folder

    <subsection name="Per-site Configuration">

      different properties files for different configurations.
      </p>
      <p>
      The sites.properties file contains the reference towards these configurations.
