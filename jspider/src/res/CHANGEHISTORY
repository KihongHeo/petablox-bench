[ SOMEDAY ] PLANNED :
---------------------

  object model for configuration
    mapping from properties files
    mapping from xml files
  rules that can change an url (remove params, ...)
  Configuration for handling of non-HTTP protocols (ftp,news,mailto,https,gopher,...)
  Add HTML WelformedNess Check (While parsing?  Afterwards?)
  improve cookiesupport (path, time to live, ...)
  support setting case-sensitivity option when comparing URLs
  support multiple fetches of same resource (comparing timing, etc...)
  xml based config files
  custom classloading (?)
    instead of putting everything on the classpath in startup scripts
    common/core/lib*.jar
    common/core/classes/
    common/ext/lib/*.jar
    common/ext/classes/
    folder common/lib/ext is also put into the classpath

[ UPCOMING ] jspider-0-5-0-dev
------------------------------

  jdk1.4 logging filepath could be problematic if not started from /bin (../x used)
  add folder-level interpretation and storage
    new report: XML sitemap (create DTD/Schema for this)
  new rule impl :
    NoURLParamsRule
    FilterURLParamsRule
    MaxResourcesPerSiteRule
    LimitedDepthSiteRule
  internal optimizations (refactoring)
  handle all todos that are still in the source code
  support decoupled eventDispatcher (per-plugin basis, async, dispatcher thread)
  support user Agent config on global AND site level
  event filtering flag on global level like on plugin level
  rules for fetching of robots.txt (like BaseSiteOnly -- avoid other sites at all!)
  support BASE HREF interpretation during html parsing
  XML dump reporting plugin in default config
    velocity plugin with different set of templates
  new event filter NonErrorsOnlyEventFilter
  optimize storage - have notion of added or changed entities and only save those
  re-introduce mail addresses, but properly handled this time
  support 'count' attribute on resource_reference -> check which pages link to another more than once

[ UPCOMING ] jspider-0-4-0-dev
------------------------------

  refactored storage:
    made sure all JDBC Exceptions are handled well and statements, etc... closed
    implemented cookie support via their own DAO
    supported Cookies in JDBC storage
    used int id as unique ids in JDBC storage impl, instead of URLs
    changed resource reference storage + implemented it in JDBC storage
    moved resource references out of SiteInternal implementation
    added ContentDAO for resource content.  This way, it is not fetched with the resource info each time
    refactored decision and decision step storage as a separate DAO
    implemented decision and decision step storage in JDBC
  added xdocs about threading configuration
  updated xdocs about site configuration
  refactoring: moved Plugin, EventFilter and Rule to spi package
  refactoring: moved rule implementations to mod package
  introduced .config.* in throttle configuration
  implemented monitoring of blocked and assigned task counter in scheduler
  upgraded templating engine in velocity plugin to velocity 1.3.1 (final)
  changed literal config names (default, tool, unittest) to final Strings on ConfigurationFactory
  fixed bug that caused some resources to be blocked twice, fetched twice, and kill JSpider with a fatal exception
  fixed bug that caused wrong userAgent to be used when retrieving robots.txt
  reworked configuration
    put config keys in final Strings (interface ConfigConstants)
    renamed properties in configuration files for more uniformity
  added junit tests for plugin instantiation logic
  create rules with properties
  new rule impl
    ForbiddenPatternRule - like robots.txt DisAllows - configured per site
  fixed bug that caused HTTP headers not to be saved in case of a 404 error
  fixed bug that causes zero-length-string site host to be saved (eg: in mailto protocol)
  fixed bug which caused html interpretation to be done by spider threads (implemented wrong tagging interface)
  added velocity-dump next to velocity-trace
  added getters to all api event classes
  brought all config files in sync (put latest config additions)
  jspider-tool: disabled logging by default
  better handling of malformed urls found while parsing (event impl)
  changed instantiation of plugins.  First, a config-param ctr is searched now, then a no-args ctr
  fixed resource length of -1 that used to be reported sometimes
  added logging via jakarta commons-logging, support for log4j and jdk1.4 logging
  implemented some command-line tools with jspider
    fetch, info, headers, download, findlinks
    e.g.: jspider-tool download http://j-spider.sourceforge.net/robots.txt
  added velocity reporting mechanism (velocity config)
  synchronized access to plugin (monitor events can come in any time)
  migrated storage to a more DAO-driven architecture
  implemented preliminary jdbc storage option
  jspider can now be configured not to obey robots.txt for a site
  new rule implementations :
    OnlyDeeperInSiteRule
  several small bugfixes
  several small refactorings
